# Pong Game

Pong Game is a Python project that brings the classic Pong game to life. It's a 2-player game where the goal is to prevent the ball from reaching your side of the screen. Use your paddle to bounce the ball back to the other player's side and score points.

## How it Works

Pong Game is a simple yet engaging 2-player game that follows these rules:

- The ball randomly bounces on the screen.
- Player 1 uses a paddle (w key & s key) to knock the ball towards Player 2's side.
- Player 2, in turn, uses a paddle (up arrow key & down arrow key) to return the ball to Player 1's side.
- If a player fails to hit the ball, the opposing player scores a point.

Please note that the project is still a work in progress, with plans to add scoring and winning conditions in the future.

## Getting Started

To play the Pong Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the game by executing `python pong_game.py`.
3. Control your paddle using the keyboard and compete against the other player.

## Roadmap

The project's future plans include:

- Adding scoring mechanisms.
- Implementing winning conditions.
